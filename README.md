# DeBound---TimeTable-Generator
This project uses Google's OR-Tools Constraint Programming (CP-SAT) solver for automated academic timetabling. The two-phase system generates conflict-free schedules: `generator1.py` for labs, and `generator2.py` for lectures. It handles complex constraints and exports a professional, color-coded Excel timetable.
